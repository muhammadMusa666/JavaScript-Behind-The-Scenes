# In This Subrepo, We Will Be Learning About Object References, Especially About Something Called Shallow Copies And Deep Copies/Deep Clones, This Is The Last Subrepo Of This Section😄, Which Is Also I Think The Biggest One In This Section, Also, You'll Need To Know About Object References And Primitives Before This, By AI, Online On Different Social Platforms, Coding Websites Like MDN, StackOverflow, W3Schools, ETC, Though This Topic Is Long And Pretty Confusing😉, If You Understand The Important Parts And Basic Areas, You'll Understand Pretty Much The Whole Thing😄, So Good Luck🫡, Take A Break After This Aswell☕, A Big One At That😅, Anyways, Let Me Know If Any Errors Occur. I Hope U Like It!
